## 2024-06-12 - [Secure SVID Serial Number Generation]
**Vulnerability:** Predictable X.509 serial numbers based on nanosecond timestamps.
**Learning:** Using timestamps for serial numbers violates RFC 5280 §4.1.2.2 and allows attackers to predict or spoof certificates if other validation layers are weak.
**Prevention:** Always use cryptographically secure random number generators (like `ring::rand::SystemRandom`) to generate at least 20 bytes for certificate serial numbers.
